Singularity
===========

Singularity is a simple newsfeed aggregator written in Vala. It has support for
RSS, RDF, and Atom feeds, but is currently at a very early stage of development,
and doesn't support these fully. It should be enough for simple browsing, but
don't expect anything special just yet!
